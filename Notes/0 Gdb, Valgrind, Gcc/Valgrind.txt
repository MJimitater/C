Valgrind isn't compatible with windows, so I'm going to be running it on an Ubuntu subsystem. 

ahhhh
2112

Ubuntu Commands:

df -h : 
cd : change directory
ls : lists files
ls -a : lists hidden files
clear : clears the terminal log
reset : restarts the terminal

Valgrind commands

valgrind ./program : runs memcheck

Good flags to use:

-v : Verbose
--leak-check=full : see details of leaked memory

We know that we don't have memory leaks when valgrind states "All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible"
