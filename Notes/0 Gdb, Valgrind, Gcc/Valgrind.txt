From now on, I'll be doing my development on my Fedora boot.

Linux commands

df -h : shows disk space
cd : change directory
	~ moves into home directory
	use ~ before typing the directory name to zoom into it
ls : lists files
	-a : lists hidden files
	-l : lists long version of files
	.. : lists files in parent folder
clear : clears the terminal log
reset : restarts the terminal
rm : Removes a file
pwd : Prints the current working directory
tree : Prints out a tree directory of wherever you are
exit : exits root user
mv filename.c .. : moves a file

Running Valgrind

valgrind ./program : runs memcheck

Good flags to use:

-v : Verbose
--leak-check=full : see details of leaked memory

We know that we don't have memory leaks when valgrind states "All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible"
