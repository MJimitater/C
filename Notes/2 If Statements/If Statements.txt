Example of comparisons

>     greater than              5 > 4 is TRUE
<     less than                 4 < 5 is TRUE
>=    greater than or equal     4 >= 4 is TRUE
<=    less than or equal        3 <= 4 is TRUE
==    equal to                  5 == 5 is TRUE
!=    not equal to              5 != 4 is TRUE

In C, a comparison will return 1 if the comparison is true and 0 if the comparison is false.

if (condition) {
    //do something
} else {
    //do something else
}

if (condition) {
    //do something
} else if (condition) {
    //do something else
} else {
    //do the last thing
}

Some boolean operators:
    &&  Logical AND operator
    ||  Logical OR operator
    !   Logical NOT operator
