An array is a sequential store of information. Arrays have a type and a size.

Syntax for a one dimensional array:
type arrayName[size];

Syntax for a two dimensional array:
type arrayName[isize][jsize]

We can also explicitly declare an entire array:
int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6}

Pointers and Arrays:
We can assign a pointer to any part of an array. For example:

int a[5];
int *p;
p = &a[0];
//p is the address of a[0]
//*p is the value of a[0]

If we don't choose the index of the array we're assigning to the pointer then it will automatically index the first element. For example:

p = &a;
//p is the address of a[0]
//*p is the value of [a]

We can also increment within an array

p++
//p is the address of a[1]
//*p is the value is a[1]
