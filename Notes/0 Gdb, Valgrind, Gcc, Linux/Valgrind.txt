From now on, I'll be doing my development on my Fedora boot.

Running Valgrind

valgrind ./program : runs memcheck

Good flags to use:

-v : Verbose
--leak-check=full : see details of leaked memory

We know that we don't have memory leaks when valgrind states "All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible"
