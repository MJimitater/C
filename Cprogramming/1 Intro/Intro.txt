#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf( "I am alive!  Beware.\n" );
    getchar();
    return 0;
}

stdio stands for standard i/o or standard input output. We need to include it in every program if we want to use functions like print, scanf, and getchar.

Every C program begins inside a function called "main".

The print function in C is printf, and \n stands for newline and creates a new line.

getchar is a function call that gets input from the user.

Finally, we return a number. By returning 0, we signal to the computer whether or not the program succeeded or not. A return value of 0 means success.

	Variables

Data types include char, int, and float.

Examples of variable declaration:

int x;
int a, b, c, d;
char letter;
float the_float;

In C you have to declare your variables before you even do anything else inside of the local scope.

Reading Input

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int this_is_a_number;

    printf( "Please enter a number: " );
    scanf( "%d", &this_is_a_number );
    printf( "You entered %d", this_is_a_number );
    getchar();
    return 0;
}

Scanf works by taking a string and some variables modified with the &. The string tells scanf what variables to look for. The %d signifies that the scanf is going to be reading in an integer, and then we sort of tell scanf what to do with the integer by signifying the variable this_is_a_number. The & tells the compiler where to put the input.

Examples of math in c
a = 4 * 6;
a = a + 5;
a == 5

a < 5
a > 5
a == 5
