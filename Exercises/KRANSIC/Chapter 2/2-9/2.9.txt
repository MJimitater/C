If x is odd, then (x-1) has the same bit representation as x except that the rightmost 1-bit is now a 0. In this case, (x & (x-1)) == (x-1).

If x is even, then the representation of (x-1) has the rightmost zeros of x becoming ones and the rightmost one becoming a zero. Anding the two clears the rightmost 1-bit in x and all the rightmost 1-bits from (x-1).
